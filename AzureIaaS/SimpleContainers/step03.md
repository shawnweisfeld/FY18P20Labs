# Simple App Containerization hands-on lab with Docker 
## Lifecycle of a container

Images of containers are immutable.  (i.e. when you start a container, and make file modifications, it does not modify the original image.)  However, you can create a new image based off of the modified container.

### Start and modify a Ubuntu container 
Start an Ubuntu Container:
```
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```

Make a change to the container and exit
```
touch /tmp/foo
ls /tmp/foo
```

Notice the file
```
exit
```

Start the container again
```
docker run â€“it ubuntu /bin/bash
ls /tmp/foo
```

### Now we will start a new image of Ubuntu and save it.
Start an Ubuntu Container:
```
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```

Make a change to the container and exit
```
touch /tmp/foo
ls /tmp/foo
```

IN A NEW WINDOW, with the container still running:
```
docker ps -a | head -2
docker diff <Container ID>
```

Commit the container
```
docker commit <Container ID> ubuntu-foo
docker run -it ubuntu-foo /bin/bash
ls /tmp/foo
```

Now the file exists
